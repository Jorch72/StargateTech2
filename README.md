[![Build Status](https://ci.theender.net/buildStatus/icon?job=StargateTech2-MC1.9)](https://ci.theender.net/job/StargateTech2-MC1.9/) You can find builds here (they may not work but try them anyway :) )

StargateTech 2 is a full (and proper) rewrite of StargateTech,
a mod based around technology and the Stargate TV shows,
essentially adding Stargate-themed technology to Minecraft.

Currently we are at version 0.7.5 for Minecraft 1.7.10
